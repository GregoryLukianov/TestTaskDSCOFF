Test Assignment:

Objective:
Create and optimize a 3D car model, set it up in Unity, and present it in a garage/showroom scene.

Tasks:

1. Modeling:
   - Create a 3D model of a car.
   - Reduce the car model to 50,000 polygons excluding the wheels(path to the model:TestTaskDSCOFF\Assets\ProvidedResources\supra\junk\untitled.fbx).
   - You can tint the car windows and remove the interior to reduce the number of polygons

2. Texturing and Materials:
   - Select textures and shaders for the model.
   - Create several simple skins for the car (1-2).
   - You can use textures from the provided resources.

3. Setting up the Scene in Unity:
   - Find or create a garage/showroom scene.
   - Place the car model in the scene.
   - Set up the scene and lighting to achieve the best visual result.

4. Optimization:
   - Optimize the project to minimize draw calls and the number of vertices in the frame.
   - Ensure the project runs smoothly without losing visual quality.

5. Deployment:
   - Upload the completed assignment to your GitHub repository and provide a link.
   - Alternatively, upload the project to Google Drive, removing all folders from the Unity project directory except the following:
     - `Assets`
     - `Packages`
     - `ProjectSettings`
     - `UserSettings`
   - If there are folders necessary for your assets to function, they should also be kept.

Additional Instructions:
- Note the balance between visual quality and performance.
- Prepare a brief description of the work process and tools used.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Quality of the 3D model and textures.
- Effectiveness of optimization and scene performance.
- Quality of lighting and materials setup in the scene.
- Ability to follow instructions and attention to detail.

Timeframe:
- You have 2-3 days to complete the assignment.

Additional Note:
- On the stage, display several car variants with different textures. The texture can be anything, even just a changed color or 2-3 colors.
- Use Unity Version 2022.3.40f1

Good luck with the assignment!
